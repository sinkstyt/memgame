// Now you'll be working to create the cards that will make up your memory game. Each card will have a value of "queen" or "king", and there should be a total of four cards. You'll also push your code up to your repository.

// Create four variables that simulate the cards in your game.

//     They should be string types.
//     Two should have a value of "queen", and the other two should have a value of "king".

//     They will represent your cards (e.g., "queen" card).
//     Name your variables cardOne, cardTwo, cardThree, and cardFour.

// My first thoughts about coding this game went the object route:
// let cards = {
//     cardOne : "queen"
//     cardTwo : "queen"
//     cardThree : "king"
//     cardFour : "king"
// };

let cardOne = "queen";
let cardTwo = "queen";
let cardThree = "king";
let cardFour = "king";
console.log("User flipped " + cardOne);
console.log("User flipped " + cardTwo);
